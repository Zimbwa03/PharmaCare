# Pharma Care System Architecture

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed system architecture for Pharma Care, a comprehensive, AI-powered pharmacy management system designed to surpass existing solutions like DispenseWare. The system will be tailored for pharmacies in Zimbabwe, adhering to local regulations, and will leverage Supabase for its backend infrastructure.

## 2. Core Modules and Enhancements

Based on the analysis of DispenseWare and leading pharmacy management systems, Pharma Care will incorporate the following core modules, with significant enhancements and new features:

### 2.1. Patient Management

*   **Enhanced Patient Registration & Profiles:** Beyond basic demographic data, capture comprehensive medical history, allergies, chronic conditions, and insurance details. Support for family accounts and dependent management.
*   **AI-Powered Patient Insights:** Analyze patient data to identify potential drug interactions, adherence patterns, and personalized medication recommendations. Proactive alerts for pharmacists.
*   **Integrated Mobile App & Patient Portal:** Secure patient access to medication history, refill requests, appointment scheduling, and educational resources. Automated notifications for refills, pickups, and health tips.

### 2.2. Dispensing & Prescription Management

*   **Intelligent Prescription Processing:** Automated verification of prescription validity (dosage, frequency, drug interactions) against patient profiles and regulatory guidelines. AI-driven suggestions for generic alternatives or therapeutic equivalents.
*   **Electronic Prescription (E-Prescription) Integration:** Seamless integration with healthcare providers for secure and efficient electronic prescription reception, reducing errors and paperwork.
*   **Workflow Optimization:** Customizable dispensing workflows with task assignment, pharmacist verification queues, and real-time status tracking to improve efficiency and reduce dispensing errors.
*   **Labeling & Packaging Automation:** Automated generation of compliant labels with clear instructions, warnings, and patient-specific information. Integration with automated dispensing and packaging systems.

### 2.3. Inventory & Supply Chain Management

*   **AI-Driven Demand Forecasting & Stock Optimization:** Utilize historical sales data, seasonal trends, and external factors (e.g., disease outbreaks) to predict demand and optimize stock levels, minimizing overstocking and stockouts. Automated reorder suggestions.
*   **Real-time Inventory Tracking:** Barcode and RFID integration for accurate, real-time tracking of all stock movements, including receiving, dispensing, returns, and inter-branch transfers.
*   **Expiry Date Management & Alerts:** Automated tracking of expiry dates with proactive alerts for soon-to-expire medications, facilitating timely rotation or disposal in compliance with regulations.
*   **Supplier Management & Automated Ordering:** Streamlined supplier management, automated purchase order generation based on stock levels and demand forecasts, and integration with wholesaler systems.
*   **Cold Chain Management:** Monitoring and alerts for temperature-sensitive medications to ensure compliance and product integrity.

### 2.4. Reporting & Analytics

*   **Comprehensive Business Intelligence Dashboard:** Real-time dashboards providing insights into sales performance, inventory turnover, prescription volume, patient demographics, and staff productivity.
*   **AI-Powered Predictive Analytics:** Forecast future sales trends, identify potential revenue opportunities, and predict patient adherence risks.
*   **Regulatory Compliance Reporting:** Automated generation of reports required by the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) and other relevant bodies, ensuring adherence to local regulations.
*   **Financial Reporting:** Integration with accounting systems for seamless financial reconciliation, profit/loss analysis, and tax reporting.

### 2.5. Regulatory Compliance & Security

*   **Zimbabwe-Specific Regulatory Framework:** Built-in compliance checks for the Medicines and Allied Substances Control Act [Chapter 15:03] and associated regulations (e.g., licensing, dispensing, storage, advertising).
*   **Data Security & Privacy:** Robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and audit trails, to protect sensitive patient and business data, complying with data protection laws.
*   **Audit Trail & Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all system activities for accountability and regulatory audits.

### 2.6. Staff Management & Communication

*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Granular permissions based on staff roles (pharmacist, technician, administrator) to ensure data integrity and security.
*   **Internal Communication Tools:** Secure messaging and task management features for efficient team collaboration.
*   **Training & Knowledge Base:** Integrated resources for staff training on system usage and regulatory updates.

## 3. AI-Powered Features

Beyond the general AI integration mentioned in core modules, specific AI features will include:

*   **Intelligent Stock Calculation:** Advanced algorithms for precise stock level recommendations, considering lead times, demand variability, and cost of holding inventory.
*   **Drug Interaction & Allergy Alerts:** Real-time AI analysis of prescriptions against patient history for critical alerts.
*   **Personalized Patient Engagement:** AI-driven recommendations for patient education, adherence programs, and health services based on individual profiles.
*   **Fraud Detection:** AI models to identify suspicious patterns in prescriptions, claims, or inventory movements.

## 4. Backend Infrastructure: Supabase

Supabase will serve as the backend for Pharma Care, offering:

*   **PostgreSQL Database:** Robust and scalable relational database for all system data.
*   **Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization, including role-based access control.
*   **Realtime Subscriptions:** For real-time updates in inventory, prescription status, and patient notifications.
*   **Storage:** Secure storage for documents, images, and other media.
*   **Edge Functions:** Serverless functions for custom backend logic and AI model integration.
*   **API Generation:** Automatic API generation for seamless frontend integration.

## 5. Workflow Integration

The system will follow a structured workflow, building upon the DispenseWare model but with significant automation and intelligence:

1.  **Product Creation & Management:** Define products, suppliers, manufacturers, and drug forms. AI assists in categorizing and suggesting initial stock levels.
2.  **Stock Receiving & Adjustment:** Record incoming stock, with AI verifying against purchase orders and suggesting optimal placement. Automated adjustments for breakages, expired drugs, and inter-branch transfers.
3.  **Patient Registration & Profile Management:** Comprehensive patient data capture, including medical history and allergies. AI flags potential risks during registration.
4.  **Prescription Processing & Dispensing:** Pharmacist selects patient, inputs/receives e-prescription. AI performs real-time checks for interactions, allergies, and regulatory compliance. Automated labeling and dispensing instructions.
5.  **Point of Sale (POS) Integration:** Seamless transfer of dispensed prescriptions to a POS system for payment processing. (Note: While DispenseWare uses Retailware, Pharma Care will aim for a more integrated or flexible POS solution).
6.  **Reporting & Analytics:** Continuous data collection feeds into AI-powered dashboards for operational insights, compliance reporting, and predictive analytics.
7.  **System Administration:** Configuration of system settings, user roles, and regulatory parameters.

This architecture aims to create a highly efficient, intelligent, and compliant pharmacy management system for the Zimbabwean market.
